After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train the network, new captions will be generated based on new images.

## The project Structure

![model](Image-Captioning/model.py): containing the model architecture.
![train](Image-Captioning/2_Training.ipynb): data pre-processing and training pipeline .
![infer](Image-Captioning/3_Inference.ipynb): generate captions on test dataset using the trained model.
